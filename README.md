StudentWorriesBlog Project
======
1. It is a social blogging application, which allows registered and logged in users (students - without specific area of study) share they thoughts by creating posts, comments and follow favourite users. App has authentication system created with Flask. User is allowed to manage own account by updating, and reseting password and changing email address. 
2. Why the project is useful: The project gives to user possibilities, to be part of social community of students, where he or she can find and share information. From developer point of view application use logical structured code with use of design pattern of factory function. 
3. When user connects with the application (register and log in using links from navber) he authenticate with it, and application starts to offer customised experience (for logged in users profile link is added to the navbar. It allows user to manage his account)
4. StudentBlog is made with Python, Flask and MySQL, with the directions from second edition of my O'Reilly book [Flask Web Development](http://www.flaskbook.com)
